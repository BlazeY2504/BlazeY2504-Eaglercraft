# BlazeY2504 Eaglercraft
The unblocked version of eaglercraft as a file that has been saved by me to send 

To get the file just click the Offline_Download_Version (1).html above and download the file then go into your files and just click it

This file generates a new link with everytime you open the file but, if you just bookmark it, it will keep the same URL so just know that when the bookmarked link has been blocked just delete the bookmark and click the file to generate a new link.
The file will be uploaded as Offline_Download_Version.html 

I do play on here so if you see me say hi! Please star if this really helps and spread the word!

To play on multiplayer just go on to the servers file and type it in to the server address
